"""Routed-expert host bank sources for the qwen3moe GGUF checkpoint.

This module loads the per-expert weight tensors that are stored as GGUF stacks
and allocates them into host banks for the offload cache. The layout is a 3D
expert stack: [num_experts, out_features, in_features] in torch order.

CRITICAL CORRECTNESS NOTE: The MoE kernel (kernel/csrc/gguf/moe_vec.cuh)
computes addressing as `blocks_per_row = ncols / qk` and
`x = vx + expert * nrows * blocks_per_row`, i.e. it assumes a FULLY PACKED
contiguous [E, nrows, blocks_per_row] layout with NO padding. So the bank
tensors must be exactly `row_bytes` wide for their own quant type — never pad
a smaller-type layer up to a larger type's stride, because the kernel would
then read every block at the wrong offset and return plausible-looking garbage.

For qwen3moe:
- ``ffn_gate_exps`` and ``ffn_up_exps`` must share a quant type per layer
- ``ffn_down_exps`` can vary independently per layer
- The gate_up bank per layer is the per-expert concatenation of gate rows
  then up rows along the output dimension, giving [E, 2*I, row_bytes(H, t)],
  valid because gate and up share a quant type and therefore a row stride.
